### Graphs Exercise

# 1. get familiar with "rivers" - how many observations?

?rivers #141 observations

x = 1:141
y = rivers

# 2. plot rivers against its index (hint: number of observation on x)
# 3. add: header (red), label names
# 4. change the point symbol and point color

plot(x, y, col = "green", 
     pch = 20, 
     main = "Lengths of\nMajor N. American Rivers",
     col.main = "red",
     xlab = "",
     ylab = "length in miles")
